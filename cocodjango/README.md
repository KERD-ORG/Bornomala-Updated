# Django Project Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to set up the Django project on your local development environment.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended for creating isolated Python environments)

## 1. Clone the Project Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone <Repository-URL>
cd <Project-Directory>
```

## 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment for Python version 3.10

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory. Populate it with the necessary environment variables as described in the project documentation or `.env.example` file, if provided.

## 5. Run Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## 6. Load Initial Data (Optional)

```bash
python manage.py loaddata all_data.json
```

## 7. Dump All Data to JSON (Optional)

To export all your database data to a JSON file, run:

```bash
python manage.py dumpdata --indent 2 > all_data_v1.json
```

This command dumps the complete data from your database into `all_data.json` with pretty indentation.

## 8. Create a Superuser (Optional)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## 9. Add .env File

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content. The URL (`http://localhost:3000`) can be changed based on your Django project URL.  
Copy contents from the `.env.example` file.

## 10. Install Redis

```bash
brew install redis
```

## 11. Run Redis

```bash
redis-server
```

## 12. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## 13. Update Translation File (If Needed)

Below is a PowerShell-friendly approach for removing your migration files and ignoring them in Git.

---

## 1. Remove All `.py` Files Under `migrations` Folders (Except `__init__.py`)

Open PowerShell in your projectâ€™s root directory and run:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -Include *.py `
| Where-Object { 
    $_.FullName -match 'migrations' -and 
    $_.Name -ne '__init__.py'
} `
| Remove-Item -Force
```

### Explanation
- **Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.py**  
  Recursively searches for all `*.py` files.
- **Where-Object {...}**  
  Filters files whose full path (`FullName`) contains `migrations` but whose filename (`Name`) is not `__init__.py`.
- **Remove-Item -Force**  
  Deletes the filtered files.

If you also want to remove any compiled `.pyc` files inside `migrations`:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -Include *.pyc `
| Where-Object { $_.FullName -match 'migrations' } `
| Remove-Item -Force
```
